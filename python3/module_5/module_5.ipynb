    "construct an \"efficient frontier\" of optimal portfolios,\n",
    "offering the maximum possible expected return for a given level of risk. It suggests that it is not enough to look at\n",
    "the expected risk and return of one particular stock. By investing in more than one stock, an investor can reap the\n",
